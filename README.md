# 3-legged-stool_Graphics
You are required to implement an application that draws a 3-legged stool as shown in figure 1. For the legs, first
create one in a display list and then draw it three times rotated appropriately using appropriate transformation.
Your application should handle user input at runtime as follows:
+ When user presses ‘x’ / ‘X’. the 3-legged stool should rotate around x-axis in CW/CCW manner
respectively.
+ When user presses ‘y’ / ‘Y’. the 3-legged stool should rotate around y-axis in CW/CCW manner
respectively.
+ When user presses ‘z’ / ‘Z’. the 3-legged stool should rotate around z-axis in CW/CCW manner
respectively.
+ When user presses ‘space’. Toggle drawing mode of the 3-legged between drawing a wireframe object or
a solid one.
